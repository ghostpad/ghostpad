**Important:** Chrome's implementation of the speech recognition API is not offline - it will send your data remotely.

**Release Notes - 0.0.1**
- This is the very first public release. If everything works perfectly, then I am the luckiest person on this entire planet. But I'm not, and there will be bugs.
- This has been tested on Linux and Mac. I think Windows should work, but these are famous last words. Please open an issue if you have any difficulties on Windows and I'll investigate.
- Major thanks to KoboldAI contributors, the Lexical team @ Meta, DaisyUI contributors, and everyone in the open LLM community.
