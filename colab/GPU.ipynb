        "KoboldAI is a powerful and easy way to use a variety of AI based text generation experiences. You can use it to write stories, blog posts, play a text adventure game, use it like a chatbot and more! In some cases it might even help you with an assignment or programming task (But always make sure the information the AI mentions is correct, it loves to make stuff up).\n",

        "1. On a phone? First put your browser in desktop mode because of a Google Colab bug. Otherwise nothing will happen when you click the play button. Then tap the play button next to \"<-- Tap This if you play on Mobile\", you will see an audio player. Keep the audio player playing so Colab does not get shut down in the background.\n",
        "2. Select the desired model, you will find a description of all the available models further down the page.\n",
        "3. Click the play button next to \"<-- Select your model below and then click this to start KoboldAI\".\n",
        "4. Got a message saying no accelerator is available? Click cancel, and try again in a few minutes. If you do not manage to get a session when you frequently try again try at a different time of day, colab can be busy or your priority may have been lowered by frequent usage.\n",
        "5. After everything is done loading you will get a link that you can use to open KoboldAI. In case of Localtunnel you will also be warned that some people are abusing Localtunnel for phishing, once you acknowledge this warning you will be taken to KoboldAI's interface. If you picked Cloudflare and get a 1033 error refresh the error page after waiting one minute.\n",

        "Firefox users need to disable the enhanced tracking protection or use a different browser in order to be able to use Google Colab without errors (This is not something we can do anything about, the cookie blocker breaks the Google Drive integration because it uses different domains)."

        "| [Nerys](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/fairseq-dense-2.7B-Nerys) by Mr Seeker | Novel/Adventure | Nerys is a hybrid model based on Pike (A newer Janeway), on top of the Pike dataset you also get some Light Novels, Adventure mode support and a little bit of Shinen thrown in the mix. The end result is a very diverse model that is heavily biased towards SFW novel writing, but one that can go beyond its novel training and make for an excellent adventure model to. Adventure mode is best played from a second person perspective, but can be played in first or third person as well. Novel writing can be done best from the first or third person. |\n",
        "| [Janeway](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/GPT-Neo-2.7B-Janeway) by Mr Seeker | Novel | Janeway is a model created from Picard's dataset combined with a brand new collection of ebooks. This model is trained on 20% more content than Picard and has been trained on literature from various genres. Although the model is mainly focussed on SFW, romantic scenes might involve a degree of nudity. |\n",
        "| [Picard](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/GPT-Neo-2.7B-Picard) by Mr Seeker | Novel | Picard is a model trained for SFW Novels based on Neo 2.7B. It is focused on Novel style writing without the NSFW bias. While the name suggests a sci-fi model this model is designed for Novels of a variety of genre's. It is meant to be used in KoboldAI's regular mode. |\n",
        "| [AID](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/GPT-Neo-2.7B-AID) by melastacho | Adventure | Also know as Adventure 2.7B this is a clone of the AI Dungeon Classic model and is best known for the epic wackey adventures that AI Dungeon Classic players love. |\n",
        "| [OPT](https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-2.7b) by Metaseq | Generic | OPT is considered one of the best base models as far as content goes, its behavior has the strengths of both GPT-Neo and Fairseq Dense. Compared to Neo duplicate and unnecessary content has been left out, while additional literature was added in similar to the Fairseq Dense model. The Fairseq Dense model however lacks the broader data that OPT does have. The biggest downfall of OPT is its license, which prohibits any commercial usage, or usage beyond research purposes. |\n",
        "| [Fairseq Dense](https://huggingface.co/KoboldAI/fairseq-dense-2.7B) | Generic | Trained by Facebook Researchers this model stems from the MOE research project within Fairseq. This particular version has been converted by us for use in KoboldAI. It is known to be on par with the larger models from EleutherAI and considered as better for pop culture and language tasks. Because the model has never seen a new line (enter) it may perform worse on formatting and paragraphing. Compared to other models the dataset focuses primarily on literature and contains little else. |\n",
        "| [Neo](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B) by EleutherAI | Generic | This is the base model for all the other 2.7B models, it is best used when you have a use case that we have no other models available for, such as writing blog articles or programming. It can also be a good basis for the experience of some of the softprompts if your softprompt is not about a subject the other models cover. |\n",

        "| Novel     | For regular story writing, not compatible with Adventure mode or other specialty modes. |\n",
        "| Adventure | These models are excellent for people willing to play KoboldAI like a Text Adventure game and are meant to be used with Adventure mode enabled. Even if you wish to use it as a Novel style model you should always have Adventure mode on and set it to story. These models typically have a strong bias towards the use of the word You and without Adventure mode enabled break the story flow and write actions on your behalf. |\n",
        "| Generic   | Generic models are not trained towards anything specific, typically used as a basis for other tasks and models. They can do everything the other models can do, but require much more handholding to work properly. Generic models are an ideal basis for tasks that we have no specific model for, or for experiencing a softprompt in its raw form. |\n",

        "# How to start KoboldAI in 7 simple steps\n",
        "Using KoboldAI on Google Colab is easy! Simply follow these steps to get started:\n",
        "1. Mobile phone? Tap the play button below next to \"<--- Tap this if you play on mobile\" to reveal an audio player, play the silent audio to keep the tab alive so Google will not shut you down when your using KoboldAI. If no audio player is revealed your phone browser does not support Google Colab in the mobile view, go to your browser menu and enable Desktop mode before you continue.\n",
        "2. Select the model that most describes what you would like to do, by default we have the most recommended model for people willing to try out KoboldAI selected. If you are an advanced user you can also type any GPT model name from Huggingface.co to load this up (Unlisted Models may or may not work depending on Colab's hardware limitations).\n",
        "3. Click the play button next to \"<--- Click this to start KoboldAI\".\n",
        "4. Allow Google Drive access, this typically happens trough a popup but sometimes Google Drive access may be requested trough the older method by asking you to click on a link and copy a code. This is normal behavior for Colab and only you will get access to your files, nothing is shared with us.\n",
        "5. Now the automatic installation and Download process starts, for most models in the GPU edition expect this to take 7 minutes on average depending on the current Colab download speeds. These downloads happen trough Google's internet connection, you will not be billed by your internet provider and it will not count towards any download limits.\n",
        "6. After waiting a Trycloudflare link appears, click the link to enjoy KoboldAI. If you get a 1033 error Cloudflare is not done loading, in that case keep refreshing until it goes away. (If it keeps happening after 2 minutes Cloudflare has an issue, in that case you can use Runtime -> Restart and Run All to get a new link).\n",
        "7. As you play KoboldAI, keep this Colab tab open in the background and check occationally for Captcha's so they do not shut your instance down. If you do get shut down you can always download a copy of your gamesave in the Save menu inside KoboldAI. Stories are never lost as long as you keep KoboldAI open in your browser.\n",
        "\n",
        "Get a error message saying you do not have access to a GPU/TPU instance? Do not continue and try again later, KoboldAI will not run correctly without them."
